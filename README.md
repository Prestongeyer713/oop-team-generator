# oop-team-generator

This application utilizes node.js and jest to compile information and push it to an html so you can view it on a website.
When you go to the command line and enter node app.js it will first ask you for your new team members name.
Once you enter the new members name it will ask you what job class they have been assigned.
If you select manager, it will ask you for there email phone number and ID.
If you select engineer, it will ask you for there email ID and Github username.
If you select Intern, it wil ask you for there email ID and current school.
Once all information is entered into the command line it takes the data and pushes it to the teamHTML found in the output file using the render fucntion.
I've added styling to make the screen easier to look at.
